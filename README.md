- 👋 Hi, I’m @SohamGade11
- 👀 I’m interested in data technologies as well as the activities carried out by a data analyst and a data scientist.
- 🌱 I’m currently learning Tableau and have prior knowledge of Python(Pandas, Numpy, Matplotlib), SQLite/PostgreSQL and Excel for the role of a data analyst.
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on different projects related to data(management & analysis) which will help me gain more knowledge about the subject.
- 📈 I'm looking for an entry level data analyst role with a view of growing even further!
